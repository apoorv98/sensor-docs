Introduction
============

This document provides insight into some of the sensor used in robotics. But
first, I would like to start with discussing the need for sensors in robots. To operate in real world environment robots need to see the obstacles and possibly manipulate them depending on application. The sensors considered here mostly focus on laser based sensing. To allow for remote sensing, means the robot should be able to tell some characteristics of an object from a distance. When a laser is used to measure the distance in an arc around the robot, it is called LIDAR. LIDAR is combination of Light and Radar, essentially a sweeping radar beam, using light.

The following sections provide user mannual for installation and testing of software for the respective sensors. All the installation was performed on system
running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS unless otherwise specified.
